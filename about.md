## On Software Development
Every time you add behavior for a specific subset of users, you're increasing the complexity of the product. These demands can pull the code in opposing directions, making it more and more difficult to maintain, and eventually slowing down development pace to a crawl. You need to know when to say "no" to customers, even if that sometimes means turning down potential revenue.

I don’t want you to boil the ocean. Just make a nice cup of tea.

there is no correlation between how easy something is to use, and how easy it is to implement.

the difference between accuracy and precision. the last 5% of performance is 50% of the cost.
