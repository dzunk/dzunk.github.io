# Matt Duszynski
Software developer extraordinaire.

## Content
I need to create some.

- List item one.
- List item two.
- A third list item for good measure.

## Design
There isn't one right now. That's because I need to generate some content first.
Don't worry though, ~~winter~~ design is coming.

Aside from serving as a personal website (which apparently everybody's doing these days), the other
purpose of this site is for me to learn about Github Pages, Jekyll, and Markdown.

## On Software Development
Every time you add behavior for a specific subset of users, you're increasing the complexity of the product. These demands can pull the code in opposing directions, making it more and more difficult to maintain, and eventually slowing down development pace to a crawl. You need to know when to say "no" to customers, even if that sometimes means turning down potential revenue.

I don’t want you to boil the ocean. Just make a nice cup of tea.

there is no correlation between how easy something is to use, and how easy it is to implement.

the difference between accuracy and precision. the last 5% of performance is 50% of the cost.

## On Government
Protest is one of the highest forms of patriotism.

## On Life
